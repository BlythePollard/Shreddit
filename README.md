# Shreddit

Shreddit is a social app built with Rails that allows users to share and view free outdoor activities in Colorado. A user can upload, edit, and delete activities that are shared with other users. User can also view their own activities, view all activities, view activities sorted by most recently created, and view activities by location in Colorado. In addition, users can "like" activities, allowing activities to collect popularity and allowing a user to see how many likes they have. 

## Installation

After cloning the repository, run 'bundle install' to ensure all gems are up-to-date. In terminal, run 'rails s' to start the server and navigate to 'http://localhost:3000/' to begin interacting with the app. 

## Usage

Once interacting with the main page, user will be prompted to either log in or create an account. To create an account, ensure that username is a minimum of 2 characters and password is a minimum of 6 characters. After account creation, user will be logged into their homepage, where they can create new activities and view and like others' activities by location or most recently created.
